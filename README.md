The back-end service for Food Brain -  An application for all the foodie trends, allowing users to mark and share their favorite dishes and reviews on an interactive map. The backend uses GraphQL endpoints to serve CRUD functionality to the frontend application in order to manage reviews and uploaded photos. The service is deployed on Heroku leveraging a PostgreSQL database for storing review data and an AWS S3 Bucket for persistent storage of the attached images.

## Reflection 
<details>
<summary>Our reflection of building Foodie Brain</summary>

During the development of the Foodie Brain, we had the opportunity to work on an exciting and challenging project that combined aspects of web development including API integration, database design, graphql, and cross-collaboration with a front-end team. This reflection highlights key aspects of our work and the lessons learned during the development of Foodie Brain.

<u>Creating Endpoints: </u>

As a team, we decided to challenge ourselves to use new technologies such as GraphQL and Apollo to serve endpoints to the front-end instead of traditional REST API endpoints. GraphQL is a query language for APIs which makes it easier for the front-end to manipulate and request only the specific data desired.

<u>Graphql: </u>

Our GraphQl setup includes numerous queries and mutations. Queries include requesting any attributes for all Reviews in the database or any attributes for a specific Review in the database. The Mutations available include creating, updating, and deleting any Reviews in the system. When a request is made to the `/graphql` endpoint, a GraphQL controller handles the queries and mutations by communicating with the Review model and Database. 

<u>Frontend Development/CORS: </u>

Our team created a separate frontend app that operated as its own service, built using React and Leaflet in order to present and manage Reviews on an interactive map. The application leveraged Apollo and GraphQL in order to make calls to this back-end service.

<u>Database Design: </u>

We used a PostgreSQL database to hold the Review object model's data and the relevant Rails ActiveStorage tables for storing attached images. With the back-end service being deployed on Heroku, file storage is only temporary. That said, we also leveraged an AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) Bucket in production in order to have persistent file storage for the related images.

<u>Successes: </u>
While this was a challenging app to build, we were able to successfully create an application that allows users to mark and share their favorite food spots and dishes on a map. Some successes include:
- Successfully implemented GraphQL to create a dynamic API.
- Successfully implemented Apollo Service to connect the frontend and backend.
- Successfully implemented ActiveStorage to store images.
- Successfully implemented CORS to allow cross-origin requests.
- Successfully implemented CircleCI to run our test suite.
- Successfully implemented Heroku to deploy our application.
- Successfully communicated and collaborated with the frontend team to create a responsive and interactive user interface that includes multiple different languages and technologies.

<u>Lessons Learned: </u>

*Throughout this project, We learned several valuable lessons:*

- The importance of communication and collaboration between frontend and backend teams.
- The importance of planning and creating a roadmap for the project.
- The importance of creating a test suite to ensure that the application is working as expected.
- The importance of research and learning new technologies.
- If able to go back we would possibly put more time into diving into the GraphQL and Apollo Service to make sure we are using it to its full potential. And other techs we thought about using but didn't have time to implement. 

In conclusion, working on this application was a challenging yet rewarding experience. It brought together various aspects of web development, challenging us to create a dynamic application. The project allowed us to expand our knowledge and skills in API integration, database design, front-end development, and introduced a new tech in GraphQL which was a fun new challenge that was exciting to unravel. And it provided valuable lessons that will guide us in future endeavors.
